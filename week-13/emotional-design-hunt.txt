# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Simplistic design, pleasant color makes user want to use it, rotund, cute shape, color uniformity  

* Behavioral: Compact shape, easy to clean, silicone sleeve for anti-slip grip, loop in cap for portability, top half unscrews for ice/cleaning, light-weight

* Reflective: Contigo brand well-known for water bottles/coffee, replaces plastic water bottles   

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. green color elicits thoughts of environmentally-friendly, recycling, hydration 
2. different color choices invoke a sense of personalization/uniqueness
3. smaller size gives a child-like, reminiscent quality compared to the popular tall, slim, stainless-steel bottles
