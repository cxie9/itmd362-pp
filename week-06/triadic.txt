When I think of children I think of primary school and primary colors. I picked more pastel colors because as vibrant as the main primary colors are, I don’t want the kids straining their eyes from the games. This was something I noticed on a lot of kids’ sites. The color scheme is too preoccupied with COLORS EVERYWHERE that they forget how harsh on the eyes bright colors can be. You can keep a child entertained without blinding them.
